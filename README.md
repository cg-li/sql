You can run the queries on:
- LeetCode’s built-in SQL console, or  
- Any local RDBMS such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Example commands:
```bash
psql -f problem_name.sql        # PostgreSQL
mysql < problem_name.sql        # MySQL
```

## Future Updates

- **Expand problem coverage:** Continue adding new LeetCode SQL problems across all difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).  
- **Enhance documentation:** Include concise comments above each query to explain the logic, design choices, and alternative approaches.  
- **Difficulty index:** Create a summary table linking problem names to difficulty, category, and key SQL concepts.  
- **Cross-dialect compatibility:** Verify and adapt queries for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite to ensure portability and compliance with SQL standards.  
- **Optimization insights:** Add notes comparing query execution plans and performance trade-offs between different SQL structures.  
- **Dataset simulation:** Provide small example datasets or schema scripts for local testing and educational demonstration.  
- **Versioned organization:** Introduce subfolders by topic or difficulty for improved readability and structure.
